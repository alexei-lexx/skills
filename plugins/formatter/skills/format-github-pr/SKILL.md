Use this skill whenever the user is about to create a PR, open a pull request, submit changes for review, or when asked to improve, format, clean up, rewrite, or polish a PR title or description — even if they just say 'make a PR', 'open a PR', 'update the PR desc', or provide a PR number/URL to fix. Produces well-formatted content ready for gh pr create / gh pr edit; does not create or update the PR itself."

# format-github-pr

Format a GitHub pull request title and description that communicates *what* changed and *why*.

## Step 1: Gather context

If the user provided a PR number or GitHub URL, look up the existing PR:
```bash
gh pr view <number> --json number,title,body,baseRefName,url
```

Otherwise, check if the current branch already has a PR:
```bash
gh pr view --json number,title,body,baseRefName,url 2>/dev/null
```

## Step 2: Determine the base branch

- Existing PR: use its current base branch
- New PR: use `main` unless the user explicitly specified otherwise

## Step 3: Analyze the changes

**For existing PRs** (when you have a PR number from Step 1):
```bash
gh pr diff <pr-number>            # actual PR diff on GitHub
```

**For new PRs** (no PR number yet):
```bash
git log <base>..HEAD --oneline    # commits on this branch
git diff <base>..HEAD --stat      # files changed
git diff <base>..HEAD             # full diff
```

Also factor in any context the user provided — they often know things the diff alone won't show (e.g. "this fixes the login bug" or "this is for issue #42").

## Step 4: Write the title

- Lowercase except proper nouns and acronyms (API, URL, CDK, AWS, etc.)
- Imperative mood: `add`, `fix`, `update`, `remove`, `migrate`, `replace`, etc.
- Specific — describe the actual change, not a vague intent
- No trailing period

**Good:** `add start/end date filters to transaction list`
**Avoid:** `Update transaction page`, `Fix issue`, `Various improvements`

## Step 5: Write the description

### Content principles

- Focus on *what* and *why* — omit implementation details unless essential for understanding
- Describe changes in plain language — explain intent and effect, not what the code says
- Concise and factual — no filler, no vague statements
- Write as a human developer — no mention of AI authorship

### Format rules

- Avoid long paragraphs — break prose into short sentences
- Start each sentence on a new line
- Include required sections: `context`, `before`, `after`
- Use lowercase section headlines
- If the branch addresses a GitHub issue, append `Close #<number>` after the last section (valid keywords: `Close`, `Fix`, `Resolve`)

### Sections

Include the following sections in the description:
- **context** — Why this change is needed — the motivation or pain point it addresses
- **before** — Describe current behavior or limitations
- **after** — Describe new behavior or improvements

Follow these rules strictly for `before` and `after` sections:
- Do not explain the code change — explain its purpose or user-facing effect
- Use bullet points
- IMPORTANT: Classify the PR as **small**, **medium**, or **big** based on scope and number of changes
- For a small PR: 1-2 bullet points
- For a medium PR: 2-3 bullet points
- For a big PR: 3-5 bullet points
- Use present tense and active voice

### Example

```
## context

Users have to manually refresh the page to see updates made by other users,
leading to stale data and confusion.

## before

- Users don't see changes from other users until they refresh
- Users work with outdated information
- Users must manually refresh to sync data

## after

- Users see changes from other users automatically
- Users work with current information
- Users don't need to manually refresh
```

## Step 6: Present the result

Return formatted title and body separately and clearly labeled:

```
**Title:**
<formatted title>

**Body:**
<formatted body>
```

Return the formatted content, then proceed to create or update the PR using available tools.
